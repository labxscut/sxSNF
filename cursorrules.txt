### Debugging
- Note: LaTeX errors may be misleading - reported error location may not be actual error source
- Best practices:
   - Compare with bug-free template for consistency
   - Debug by disabling/commenting-out recently changed slides
   - Use working slide templates as reference
   - Mimic code structure from template slides
   - Build presentation slide by slide, starting from title page
   - Use `\maketitle` for title page generation
